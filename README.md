# Fast-Lemmatization

- The idea of ​​increasing the speed of lemmatization by increasing the cluster size is taken from this [article](https://habr.com/ru/articles/503420/). 
- In addition to the described procedures, caching with the lru_cache decorator is used.
- Lemmatization results from a [large file](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140) of 1600000 lines
